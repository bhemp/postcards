# RetroCard - Vintage Postcard Generator

RetroCard allows a user to quickly generate a vintage-styled postcard using their own photos.


I originally envisioned this as a native mobile app, but it currently only uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery. I've started this as a final project for a Intro to Computer Science class. As my skills increase, I can see this being greatly improved by implementing a more advanced JavaScript or mobile framework.
